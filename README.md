# ChurnAnalysis-PwC
Customer Risk Analysis and Churn Dashboard

- This Project is a part of the Power BI virtual case experience, by PwC Switzerland, on the Forage platform.
  The brief provided by Phone Now, a telecom company was:
  1. Define KPIs
  2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
  3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

- Background Information On The Task, Provided in the task instructions:
  1. Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
  2. The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
  3. Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary; it would be better to know in advance        who is at risk 
  4. We  have done customer analysis with Excel, but it has always ended in a dead-end
  5. We would like to know more about our customers; visualized clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

- The dataset consisted of an XLS file provided by Maven Analytics. The steps involved in the production of this Business Intelligence Report were as follows:
  1. Data Extraction - Extracted the data from the XLS file into the Power Query Editor.
  2. Data Hygiene and Transformation - Corrected data types, promoted headers, and cleaned null values and duplicates.
  3. Data Transformation - Added new columns for future measures, such as loyalty, senior citizen, etc.
  4. Data Processing - Created explicit measures using DAX and added calculated, conditional columns where necessary.
  5. Data Visualization and Report Building - Developed a fully interactive dashboard with dedicated customer risk analysis, a welcome         page, and a churn dashboard. Various visuals, such as gauges, KPI cards, and treemaps, were included.

- Insights:
    1. Enhance technical support availability for Fiber Optic customers and reduce the average number of technical support tickets per           customer to 0.5.
    2. Boost sales of both 1-year and 2-year contracts by 5% each.
    3. Achieve an annual growth of 5% in the adoption of automatic payment methods.
